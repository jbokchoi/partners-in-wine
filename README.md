# Partners in Wine

Keep track of your favorite wines and see what your friends are drinking.


Because the best wines are the ones we drink with friends.

<a href = https://partners-in-wine.herokuapp.com>Partners in Wine</a> is a catalogue of wines populated by users, keeping track of the most basic information to help you remember all the wonderful - or not so wonderful - wines you encounter. 

Never again will you be stuck wishing you could remember the name of that fabulous wine that you had at that wonderful place.



## Features:
- Add all the wines you encounter and populate the Partners in Wine's wine catalogue
- Leave reviews on the wines you've tried or check out other partners' reviews if you're looking for recommendations
- Make lists of wines: your favorites, all the wines from your holiday, ones you'd rather not have again...
- Find your friends - and make new ones! - and see that they're drinking
